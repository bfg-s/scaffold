# Scaffold packageThe essence of the package is to design a database and initial data in a visual syntax for further processing it and forming layers for working with laravel.## More detailsA package for creating laravel layers according to a single syntax that is based in a simple array representing a set of rules and conditions that are necessary to build the initial data of the project architecture. We are talking about things like: `Models`, `Model Constants`, `Model Relations`, `Migrations`, `Model Behaviors (Traits)`#### Coming Soon`Factories`, `Controllers or Resource Controllers`, `Resources`, `Requests`, `Seeding`, `Observers`, `Jobs`, `Mail`, `Events and Listeners`, `Commands` and `Laguages`.## Array syntaxFirst, you need to understand how to design an array of scaffolding for your project. > It is important that you definitely need to understand the whole > project in order to make the most correct design of your project > and database in one place.Let's consider a simple design method, this is a `JSON` file.> This approach is simplified for easy integration and fast implementation.Simple example of preschool database structure:```json{  "commentary": {    "const:title": "Comments",    "type": "morphMany:commentable",    "fields": [      ["name", ["nullable"]],      ["src", ["nullable"]],      "active"    ]  },  "rules": {    "const:title": "Rules",    "fields": ["title", "text", "active"],    "relations": {      "commentary": {}    }  },  "director": {    "const:title": "Directors",    "traits": ["Authenticatable", "Authorizable", "Notifiable", "SoftDeletes", "Getter", "Setter", "Scope"],    "fields": ["name", "last_name", "active"],    "relations": {      "commentary": {},      "reward:hasMany": {        "const:title": "Rewards",        "fields": ["name", "license", "photo", "handed_over_at", "active"]      }    }  },  "school": {    "const:title": "Schools",    "traits": ["Getter", "Setter", "Scope", "Wets"],    "fields": ["name", "description", "active", "active"],    "relations": {      "director": {},      "commentary": {},      "group:hasMany": {        "const:title": "Groups",        "fields": ["name", ["slogan", ["nullable"]], "active"],        "relations": {          "commentary": {},          "educator:belongsToMany": {            "const:title": "Educators",            "fields": ["name", "last_name", "active"],            "relations": {              "commentary": {}            }          }        }      },      "service:belongsToMany": {        "const:title": "Services",        "fields": ["name", "amount", "description", "active"],        "relations": {          "commentary": {}        }      },      "tags:belongsToMany": {        "const:title": "Tags",        "fields": ["name", "active", "is_new", "mark_at"]      }    }  }}```If the file `/ database / scaffolds.json` does not exist, then after the first run of the command` php artisan scaffold` this file will be created automatically! Then you need to fill it with data for generation and re-run the command `php artisan scaffold`.For publish this demo:```bashphp artisan vendor:publish --tag=scaffold-demo```### Now in detail about the array```{  "{Singular model name}": { //All fields except names are optional    "const:{Constant name}": "Constant value", //optional    "path": "app/Models", //by default    "namespace": "App\\Models", //by default    "foreign": "id", //by default    "timestamps": true, //by default    "traits": ["Getter", "Setter", "Scope", "Wets"], //Injected traits. optional    "type": "{Type name}:{Type parameters}", //The parent type when adding this model as a link. by default hasOne.    "fields": [ //optional      ["{Field name}", "Field param",{"Field methods": "Field properties"}],      ["src", ["nullable"]],      ["bet", "float", 8, 2, {"default": "0.01"}],      "active" //by default this field is: ['float', 8, 2]    ],    "relations": {      //The name of the relationship can also be plural, in which case it will find or create a model.      "{Relation name}{:Relation type name (optional)}": {        //...new model data, or empty object if model exists      },      "tags:belongsToMany": {        "const:title": "Tags",        "fields": ["name", "active", "is_new", "mark_at"]      },      "rewards": {}    }  }}```## ConfigsFor publish config:```bashphp artisan vendor:publish --tag=scaffold```All properties are documented in a file that were publishedin the `/config/scaffold.php` file.## Clear the generated data from the application.In order to clear constantly regenerated data from your application, run the command `php artisan scaffold:clear`.In order to delete all the files that created the scaffolding altogether, add the `-a` or `--all` flag to the command `php artisan scaffold:clear -a`.## More flexible `php` apiComing Soon...
